Software selection is all about choosing a solution with great technical functionality. It often starts with a focus on a long 
list of features. The best approach is to list known apps then expand research and later shorten your list on viability and 
credibility criteria.

How to streamline your software selection sequence

*Search for solutions- An iterative process helps you achieve this. For example, a series of web searches involving 
keywords and then refining results by elimination may aid in identifying potential software solutions.

*Review updates- Identify changes made to the app by either reviewing release notes and dates or by checking publicly posted 
change logs or blogs.

*Prefer public people- A preference to use systems from companies where real people, photos, names, titles, bios, and contact 
information are provided. Most software vendors publish little or no information about the people behind the product.

*Consider cost- A cost estimate of the usage scenario should be made to enhance company trust.

Evaluate features- After the above four assessments, you need to move to the detail evaluation stage to make sure the system 
does what you need, in a workflow you like and supports the available devices and systems.

Most developers skip to the evaluation stage leaving other factors like updates, preference, and cost behind. Kweli Capital 
developers should however consider going through all the 5 steps as each step helps eliminate systems that do not work with 
existing systems, arenâ€™t updated, or are not open and transparent in terms of either people or pricing.
