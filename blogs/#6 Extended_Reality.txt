XR refers to all read-and-virtual combined environments and human-machine interactions generated by computer 
technology and wearables. It includes representative forms such as augmented reality (AR), mixed reality 
(MR), and virtual reality (VR). All immersive technologies extend the reality we experience by either 
blending the virtual or “real” worlds. Recent research revealed that more than 60% of respondents believed XR
will mainstream in the next five years.

In AR virtual information and objects are overlaid in the real world. This experience enhances the real world 
with digital details such as images, text, and animation. In contrast to AR, in a virtual reality experience, 
users are fully immersed in a simulated digital environment. In mixed reality, digital and real-world objects 
co-exist and can interact with one another in real-time. This is the latest immersive technology and is 
sometimes referred to as hybrid reality.

There are many practical applications of XR which are marketing, real estate, remote work, training, and 
retail. The main focus of this article in relation to Kweli Capital Ltd is marketing and real estate. XR

possibilities to engage with prospective customers through XR will have marketing professionals considering 
all the potential of using XR to a company’s advantage.
