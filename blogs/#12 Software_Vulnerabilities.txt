Software vulnerability is a defect in software that could allow an attacker to gain control of the system. It causes exploitation 
and can violate the security pillars, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA).

The major contributors to software security flaws are a non-evolving security posture, the absence of secure and effective 
software best practices, the knowledge disparity between developers and threat actors, and insecure legacy software.

An evolving security posture is necessary for a successful security program due to ever-changing threats. Reliance on internal 
compliance against the backdrop of a no-evolving security policy as evidence of secure software development is short-sighted.

The use of secure best practices in SDLC facilitates proactive vulnerability detection and remediation before deployment. 
Application of secure design principles where applicable bolsters application security. However, routine training for 
developers and testers must be prioritized.

There are varying reasons for the growth of knowledge disparity between developers and threat actors. However, some contributors 
are mindset, primary focus, and lack of learning opportunities. Developers must be aware of current and ever-expanding attack 
vectors.

Organizations now realize the significance of executing due diligence to implement and maintain a secure SDLC and infrastructure. 
Since threat vectors are constantly evolving, Kweli Capital developers must engage in continuous learning regarding secure 
software development.
