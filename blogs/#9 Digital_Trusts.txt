Digital trust is the degree of confidence a customer has that technology, person or process is capable of 
upholding security, privacy, safety, reliability, and credibility online.

With many tech giants coming under fire for violating the digital trust of their users, many changes have 
been made to make it safer for those using digital platforms. The main changes you need to be aware of are:

*Increasing cybersecurity- This can be done by enacting certain cyber security processes and building
secure systems to improve trust.

*Verify all claims- Using high-quality sources in content, as well as lots of data analysis to back up any 
claims, will go a long way to provide digital trust to your audience.

*Increased use of blockchain- With blockchain, security is stronger than other conventional transactional 
methods due to its end-to-end encryption.

*Advocating for digital privacy- Advocating and regulating under GDPR and storing data in closed databases 
are all important ways to do this.

*Increasing trust through user experience- Customers are much more likely to be happy sharing their data if 
it is in their interests to do so. If their experiences with a business are highly personalized, they are 
more likely to trust a company.

In the coming years, digital trust will be the most important aspect of customer gaining and retention. It 
will continue to evolve and businesses will have to keep up to ensure customers are not worried about their 
data security. Therefore, Kweli Capital should look to adapt and make these changes so as to assure data 
security for their customers.
