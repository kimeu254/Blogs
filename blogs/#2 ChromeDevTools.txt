Dev tools are programs that allow a developer to create, test and debug software. The chrome dev tools are a 
goldmine, and some of its best features are sometimes overlooked. Dev tools are incredibly useful for 
debugging and implementing application features. When debugging a feature that does not work expectedly, 
there is a high probability that the problem lies in the data that the feature uses especially when working 
with APIs, requests or functions. The popularly used and effective features are Breakpoints, Accessibility 
Trees, Memory inspector and the Network Tab.

Breakpoints allow you to pause code at a specific line in a method and access all the variables in-scope for 
the selected line or method. Sometimes it is useful to only pause the code when a certain condition is met. 
This is easily achieved through conditional breakpoints. Accessibility trees offer simplicity in reading by 
proving an overview of the pageâ€™s tree. With memory inspectors, debugging code that works using typed array 
is made easier because bytes are decoded to obtain strings. The network tab provides useful insights which 
is made possible by understanding the structure of an application and technology used.

The enlightenment to Kweli Capital developers from this article is that the Chrome dev tools are serviceable 
and critical practices to exponentially grow your knowledge and build better products.
