Daily blog #1: CodeWhisperer

CodeWhisperer is an AI CODE-writing tool for programmers launched by Amazon to help software developers in 
writing code. It searches for security and biasness in developers' projects. It also offers programming 
advice to thes users. Machine learning (ML) is used to power the recently released CodeWhisperer service.
According to AWS, the suggestions will be based on developers' code in the IDE.

Multiple programming languages, frameworks, libraries and well-known cloud services are sorted out while a
developer writes code. CodeWhisperer generates user's command and chooses the best library and cloud service
for the task. It then provides a code sample in the source code editor.

The AI algorithm is available for languages like Java, JS and Python and Jetbrain, VSC, AWS Cloud9 for the 
IDEs. Additionally, developers may protect their scripts by utilizing CodeWhisperer to find vulnerabilities
in their projects and create projects responsibly.
