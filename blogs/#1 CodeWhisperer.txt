CodeWhisperer is an AI code-writing tool for programmers launched by Amazon to help software developers in 
writing code. It searches for security and biases in developers' projects. It also offers programming advice 
to its users. Machine learning (ML) is used to power the recently released CodeWhisperer service. According to AWS, the 
suggestions will be based on developers' code in the IDE.

Multiple programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and well-known cloud services are sorted out while a 
developer writes code. CodeWhisperer generates the user's command and chooses the best library and cloud 
service for the task. It then provides a code sample in the source code editor. The AI algorithm is available
for languages like Java, JS, and Python, and Jetbrain, VSC, and AWS Cloud9 for the IDEs. 

Therefore, CodeWhisperer can aid Kweli Capital developers in saving time through auto-completion of entire 
functions. Additionally, developers may protect their scripts by utilizing CodeWhisperer to find 
vulnerabilities in their projects and create projects responsibly.
