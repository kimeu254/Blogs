Data governance is the process of managing the availability, usability, integrity and security of data in 
enterprise systems, based on internal data standards and policies that also control data usage. Some key 
practices for accomplishing data governance include:

*	Defining the proper process in alignment with the right people- creating a unified database along with a 
master dataset can standardize how data is used. Also, defining roles to every program as such the right 
people can access the best-suited data as they need it yields the best results/insights.

*	Building the roadmap that ensures trusted data always- Organizations should align their business 
objectives with high-quality data creation and implementation to improve decision-making. Performing 
analytics without quality data can lead to inaccurate interpretations hence poor decisions.

*	Become consistently compliant with regulatory requirements- adhering to critical compliance and 
regulatory mandates is essential to minimize risks and operational costs.

*	Evaluate risks across the board- data security starts with understanding the related risks to 
distributed data. The organization structure should ensure appropriate access to data while maintaining 
adequate privacy.

*	Bring the right data management platform to the table- a forward-thinking organization should look into 
the future, aligning its data governance expectations with its technology stack to implement robust quality, 
risk assessments, and ongoing monitoring and testing mechanisms.

Data is the most significant asset to any organization and should be governed accordingly. Therefore,
