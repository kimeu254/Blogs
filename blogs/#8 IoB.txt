The Internet of Things has been extended to the Internet of Behavior where data is collected from multiple 
connected devices to get valuable insights into customer interests. It is a powerful tool and has numerous
applications icluding location tracking, healthcare industry, travel itenary, credit score tracking and 
logistics.

Data collected through IoB is useful in deciphering the habits of customers across different platforms and 
also engaging with customers in real-time. By gathering insights into customer preference, you can enhance 
investment decisions like tailoring campaigns based on the available insights. The major shortcoming to this 
would be to personalize information towards its targets. Information on IoB will be available in the future. 
Approximately 3 billion people are set to experience the IoB in various capacity in 2022 hence has a sure 
shot impact on future services.

The major lesson from this blog is that IoB helps identify customer behavior recommendations and patterns. 
This helps achieve long-term customer growth and satisfaction.
